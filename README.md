# Diabetes Prediction Project

## 📜 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has diabetes using machine learning techniques based on certain diagnostic attributes. The goal is to use patient data to classify if someone is likely to be diabetic or not. By analyzing key health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, and age, we can build a predictive model to assist healthcare providers with early detection.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** for data manipulation and model building.
- **Pandas** for data wrangling and handling.
- **NumPy** for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for building machine learning models.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of medical diagnostic attributes of several patients, including:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age (years)

## 🔑 Key Steps in the Project
### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values by imputing with median values for features like BMI and glucose levels.
- Scaled the features to ensure uniformity across different data ranges.
  
### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Generated visualizations to understand feature distributions and correlations.
- Identified glucose levels and BMI as strong predictors of diabetes.

### 3. **Model Building**
- Tried different machine learning models to predict the probability of a patient being diabetic:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Random Forest**
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated each model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their effectiveness.
- The Random Forest model yielded the highest accuracy (X%).

### 5. **Feature Importance**
- Conducted a feature importance analysis to find the most significant predictors of diabetes.
- Glucose and BMI were found to be the top contributing features to the prediction accuracy.

## 🎯 Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test set. It provides a valuable foundation for building diabetes detection tools with further tuning and additional data.
